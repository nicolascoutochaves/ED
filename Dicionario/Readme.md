# Text Translator

## This code compares three types of BST, one normal BST and two balanced trees: AVL and Splay.

The main concept of the code is read a input text from a file, a dictionary containing the word and your translation and an output text. In the end it's generate some stats for the three BSTs used to translate the input.

It's similar to the lexical analysis used in a compilers.
